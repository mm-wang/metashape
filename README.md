geometry clustering of shapes based on trained features

The goal is to get a set of geometries and cluster those geometries and then be able to predict a category.

## Initial Primitives
As a prototype, we developed a sample set of 16 elements that were categorized into cones, cylinders, spheres, and boxes.


## Initial Clustering
This set was trained in scikit-learn and Accord.NET through dodo, lunchbox, owl. Owl fit our needs in predictive modeling most effectively.

## Shape Analysis
